# Photobooth

Every 5 years or so it seems like I take another stab at a photobooth, here is 2024's incarnation

## Configure

You can configure the text by adding a `.env` with something like:

```.env
VITE_LINE_1="James'"
VITE_LINE_2="Birthday!"
VITE_LINE_3="September 27    2024"
VITE_LINE_3_SUPERSCRIPT="th"
VITE_LINE_3_SUPERSCRIPT_OFFSET=-10;
```

You can update the settings but updating things in `/app/constants/`

This is designed for an Amazon Fire HD 10, to adjust screen and webcame settings see: `app/constants/screen.ts`

For colors see: `app/constants/colors.ts`

Font and other final image settings: `app/constants/canvas.ts`

## Usage

`npm run prod` will build and serve a prod build on 5173.

It takes 3 images and then you can "Yeti-ize" any of them and remove the background and insert a yeti!

It uses IPP/AirPrint to send the image to the printer. It works on a Canon Selphy at least, didn't test any other printers.

The final image is a 4x6 which can be cut into 2 strips.
